#Description: C# like language for the GObject system
# Vala is a new programming language that aims to bring modern programming
# language features to GNOME developers without imposing any additional
# runtime requirements and without using a different ABI compared to
# applications and libraries written in C.
# .
# valac, the Vala compiler, is a self-hosting compiler that translates
# Vala source code into C source and header files.  It uses the GObject
# type system to create classes and interfaces declared in the Vala
# source code. This package also contains the vala-gen-introspect and
# vapigen binaries that will automatically generate Vala bindings.
# .
# This package always depends on the currently supported version
# of valac but doesn't have any content by itself.
